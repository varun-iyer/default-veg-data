Methods: 
Data collection was performed at a catered event on a college campus. Eligibility of individual participants included 
being 18 years or older and an invitation to RSVP for an enrolled event. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 
two groups: the control group received a RSVP form that presented a meat meal as the default catering option whereas the 
intervention group received a form that presented a plant-based meal as the default. 24 hours after the event, participants
were debriefed and a follow-up survey was administered.

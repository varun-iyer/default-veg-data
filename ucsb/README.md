default_study.csv contains de-identified survey responses.  There are five data
columns:
1. response to a meat-default selection question
2. response to a plant-default selection question
3. identification as vegan, vegetarian, or pescatarian
4. age range
5. default experiment: this CSV file consolidates data from two separate
   experiments, a large undergraduate event and a smaller event with graduate
   students. The final column notes which event the data is from.

Only one of  the response columns will be
filled for each person, which indicates the phrasing of the question they
received (plant vs. meat default).
